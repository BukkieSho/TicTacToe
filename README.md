# Tic Tac Toe 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. It is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row.

## Game Objective
Fill 3 squares in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

## Game Rules
Players take turns placing their X or O, on an open square in the grid. The first player to make 3 of their own mark in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is considered a Tie.

## Pseudocode
1) Define the required variables used to track the state of the game:
2) Store cached element references on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code more concise, readable, and performant:

3) Upon loading, the app should:
	3.1) Call an initialize function to initialize the state variables
	3.2) Render those values to the page
	3.3) Wait for the user to click a square
4) Define the required constants
5) Handle a player clicking a square
